### Introduction


Come and join a fellowship of Deep Learning and AI enthusiasts in their quest to keep up with the latest developments in
artificial intelligence and cloud computing ! We recently restarted in-person events after a long break. 

This group is for intermediate and advanced practitioners of deep learning utilizing TensorFlow. Our plan is to organize
a weekly or bi-weekly event in which we will collectively analyze the latest and seminal research papers in the field of
AI. We will be covering anything from computer vision, natural language processing to deep reinforcement learning and
Bayesian networks. These meetups are intended to be an open discussion of the selected paper, related research and
relevant model coding.

If you get a chance to read the paper before the meetup that is great. If not don't worry. We will be doing a detailed
presentation covering the findings outlined in the paper, so if you don't get a chance to read it you can still come to
the session and join in the discussion.

Our goal is to create an interactive study group where we collectively choose the research papers that we'd like to dig
into and share the lessons we learn from attempting to execute the architecture in our own applications. Your feedback
will be valuable in determining the structure and content of the event in the future.
