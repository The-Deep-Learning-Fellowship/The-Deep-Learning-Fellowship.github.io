The [U-Net model](https://paperswithcode.com/method/u-net) (Ronneberger et al) is a used for semantic segmentation
applied to the medical imaging domain.

[UCTransnet](https://paperswithcode.com/method/uctransnet) : Rethinking the Skip Connections in U-Net from a Channel-wise Perspective with Transformer implements a
mechanism to balance the contributions of the original skip connections of the original model. 

This paper has been presented on May 18th 2020 at the CDLF.
